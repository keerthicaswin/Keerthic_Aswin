Brief Intro about myself and the repositories with my analysis pipelines


# 👋 Hi, I'm Keerthic Aswin

I'm a **PhD student** working at the interface of **computational, molecular, and cell biology** and I combine hands-on lab experiments with in-depth computational analysis to explore complex biological phenomena.

🔬 **Research Interests**  
- 🧬 Single-cell analysis  
- 🧫 Small RNA biology & regulatory networks  
- 🌿 Phylogenetics and evolutionary genomics  

💡 I enjoy developing computational workflows to answer biological questions, bridging experimental and computational research.

📍 Currently working on projects involving:  
- Dissecting cellular heterogeneity using single-cell omics  
- Exploring small RNA functions across development and disease  
- Tracing evolutionary relationships using phylogenetic tools  

## 🔬 Featured Projects (Private Repositories)

I actively develop and maintain several advanced pipelines tailored for diverse sequencing data types:

- 🧬 **RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline**  
  Robust pipeline for bulk RNA-seq preprocessing, differential expression, and visualization.

- 🧪 **Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) Workflow**  
  Complete end-to-end analysis framework from FASTQ to cluster annotation using Seurat and custom tools.

- 🎯 **piRNA Target Mapping Platform**  
  Custom-built toolkit for mapping piRNA complementary regions and predicting functional targets.

🗝️ These repositories are **private**, but I’m happy to collaborate or share access with interested researchers, collaborators, or institutions.

📬 **Reach out to me** if you're interested in accessing the code or discussing a collaboration
