Brief Intro about myself


# 👋 Hi, I'm Keerthic Aswin

I'm a **PhD student** working at the interface of **computational, molecular, and cell biology** and I combine hands-on lab experiments with in-depth computational analysis to explore complex biological phenomena.

🔬 **Research Interests**  
- 🧬 Single-cell analysis  
- 🧫 Small RNA biology & regulatory networks  
- 🌿 Phylogenetics and evolutionary genomics  

💡 I enjoy developing computational workflows to answer biological questions, bridging experimental and in silico research.

📍 Currently working on projects involving:  
- Dissecting cellular heterogeneity using single-cell omics  
- Exploring small RNA functions across development and disease  
- Tracing evolutionary relationships using phylogenetic tools  

📫 Feel free to reach out or explore my work here on GitHub!
